# Spotify-Data
Spotify Data is an app that brings you charts on your phone. These charts show you your most listened artist or song for a particular time. It was done with the framework `react-native`.

## How to Download

### Download on your phone
If you have an android phone download it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vichmi.Spotify.Data). If you have iPhone you will need to build the app for yourself from the repo. 

### Download the repo
Clone the repo and make sure you have installed `expo-cli` then install the dependencies with `npm install` after that type `expo start` and you are all set.

## How does it work

This app doesn't still any of your personal data from Spotfy. After you are loged in with your Spotify account, the app makes a request to the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/console/) that gives a data about your top 100 most listened artists and tracks, play, add to queue and add to playlist a particular song, data about a particular song or artist.
